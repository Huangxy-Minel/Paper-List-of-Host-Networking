# Reading-List-of-Host-Networking
## Introduction
The performance of data center network facilities, including switches, routers, and network interface cards (NICs), has advanced significantly in recent years: the network bandwidth has surged from 10 Gbps to 100/200/400/800 Gbps to accommodate the increasing communication demands of datacenter applications such as cloud computing, big data analytics, machine learning and AI. Although promising, the performance of network Input/Output (I/O) architectures remains suboptimal due to inefficient utilization of host resources, limiting the full potential of data center network infrastructure. We refer the network consists of intra-host endpoints including CPUs, GPUs, NICs, interconnections (e.g., PCIe and NV-switch), and disks to **Host Network**. In this topic, we aim to explore more efficient I/O data path (responsible for data movement) and control path (responsible for routing, scheduling, traffic controlling, etc.) to improve the end-to-end throughput and reduce tail latency between every two endpoints.

This reading list is mainly served for new students of iSING Lab @ HKUST. So far (02/12/2024), most of works mainly focus on the path between CPUs and NICs. Thus, the story for this reading list is about where the bottleneck occurs and how to address it in the CPU-to-NIC path. We believe there will be more works target to other paths like GPU-to-GPU, CPU-to-GPU, GPU-to-NIC or target to the utilization of interconnection. Hopefully the list can help readers to explore interesting and exciting ideas.
